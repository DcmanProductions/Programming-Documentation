# spdlog

spdlog is a fast, feature-rich, and easy-to-use logging library for C++. It is built using C++11 and can be used either as a header-only library or as a static library (which reduces compile time). spdlog provides various logging levels (e.g., info, error, warn, critical) and supports customizable log patterns, making it suitable for different use cases and environments. It also supports compile-time log levels and can be used in various platforms, including ROS2 and Android projects
