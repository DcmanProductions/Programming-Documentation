# Struct vs Class

In C#, both structs and classes are used to create custom data types. The main difference between them is how they behave and how they are stored in memory.

Think of a struct as a small, self-contained object that holds simple data, like a single value. It's like having a little box that directly stores the data inside it. Structs are quick to create and use less memory because they are stored directly where they are needed.

On the other hand, a class is more like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It's like having a set of instructions on how to build a more complex object. Classes take up a bit more memory because they are stored in a separate area called the heap, which allows for more flexibility in managing larger and more complicated objects.

When you create a new struct, it automatically gets initialized with default values. For example, if you have a struct for a person's age, it will start with a default value of 0. With a class, you need to define how it should be created and what initial values it should have.

Classes can have more advanced features like inheritance, which means one class can inherit characteristics from another. Think of it like a family tree where one class can inherit traits from its parent class. Structs, however, can't inherit from other structs or classes.

Sometimes, there is a need to treat a struct as an object, and this involves a process called "boxing." It's like putting a small box inside a bigger box. This process can affect performance because it adds extra steps. Classes, being larger objects to start with, don't require this boxing process.

In summary, structs are like small, simple containers that hold data directly, while classes are more like blueprints for creating complex objects. Structs are efficient for small data and quick operations, while classes provide more flexibility and features for larger and more complex scenarios.
