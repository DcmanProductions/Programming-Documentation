# Primitive Types

Primitive types are basic data types built into the language that represent fundamental values. They are used to store and manipulate simple values directly without relying on more complex objects. Here are the different primitive types in C# with examples:

1.  `bool`: Represents a Boolean value that can be either `true` or `false`. Example:

    ```csharp
    bool isReady = true;
    ```
2.  `byte`: Represents an 8-bit unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 255. Example:

    ```csharp
    byte age = 27;
    ```
3.  `sbyte`: Represents an 8-bit signed integer ranging from -128 to 127. Example:

    ```csharp
    sbyte temperature = -10;
    ```
4.  `short`: Represents a 16-bit signed integer ranging from -32,768 to 32,767. Example:

    ```csharp
    short population = 5000;
    ```
5.  `ushort`: Represents a 16-bit unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 65,535. Example:

    ```csharp
    ushort count = 10000;
    ```
6.  `int`: Represents a 32-bit signed integer ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Example:

    ```csharp
    int score = 100;
    ```
7.  `uint`: Represents a 32-bit unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Example:

    ```csharp
    uint distance = 5000;
    ```
8.  `long`: Represents a 64-bit signed integer ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Example:

    ```csharp
    long population = 7500000000;
    ```
9.  `ulong`: Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Example:

    ```csharp
    ulong bigNumber = 9999999999;
    ```
10. `float`: Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point number. Example:

    ```csharp
    float pi = 3.14f;
    ```
11. `double`: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point number. Example:

    ```csharp
    double distance = 1500.75;
    ```
12. `decimal`: Represents a decimal number with higher precision for financial and monetary calculations. Example:

    ```csharp
    decimal amount = 99.99m;
    ```
13. `char`: Represents a single Unicode character. Example:

    ```csharp
    char grade = 'A';
    ```
14. `string`: Represents a sequence of characters. Example:

    ```csharp
    string name = "John Doe";
    ```

These primitive types provide a range of options to store and manipulate different kinds of data, including numeric values, Boolean values, characters, and strings. They are the building blocks of more complex data structures and are widely used in C# programming.
