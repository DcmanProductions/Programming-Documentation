# Struct vs Class

In C#, both structs and classes are used to define custom data types, but they have some important differences in terms of their behavior and usage. Here are the key distinctions between structs and classes in C#:

1. Value Type vs. Reference Type: Structs are value types, while classes are reference types. When you declare a variable of a struct type, the actual value is stored directly in the variable. On the other hand, variables of class type store a reference (memory address) to the actual object in memory.
2. Memory Allocation: Structs are typically allocated on the stack, while classes are allocated on the heap. The stack is generally faster to allocate and deallocate memory from, while the heap allows for more flexibility in terms of object size and lifetime.
3. Default Behavior: Structs have a default parameterless constructor, whereas classes do not. This means that you can create a new struct instance without explicitly providing constructor arguments, and all its fields will be automatically initialized to their default values (e.g., 0 for numeric types). In contrast, when creating a class instance, you must either define a parameterless constructor explicitly or provide constructor arguments.
4. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Classes support inheritance and polymorphism, allowing you to create class hierarchies and define relationships between classes using inheritance and interfaces. Structs, on the other hand, cannot inherit from another struct or class, nor can they be used as a base for inheritance.
5. Boxing and Unboxing: Boxing is the process of converting a value type (such as a struct) to an object reference, while unboxing is the reverse process. Classes do not require boxing or unboxing when they are assigned or passed as method arguments, as they are reference types. However, structs are value types, and when they need to be treated as objects, they need to be boxed, which incurs some performance overhead.
6. Performance Considerations: Due to their value type nature and stack allocation, structs are generally more efficient in terms of memory usage and access speed, especially for small data structures. Classes, being reference types with heap allocation, involve an extra level of indirection, which may result in slightly slower performance.

In practice, you would typically use a struct when you have a small, lightweight data structure that represents a single value (e.g., coordinates, date/time), whereas classes are used for more complex objects with behavior, encapsulation, and potential inheritance requirements.
